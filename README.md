## Assignment B1: Making a function

***

This contains the function `fn.Summarize.by.Group` which computes descriptive statistics (Count, Sum, Mean) of a numeric variable grouped by a categorical variable.

The function takes in 3 arguments: (1) a data frame, (2) a categorical variable to be grouped by, and (3) a numeric variable on which descriptive statistics are computed.
